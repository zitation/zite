    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <blockquote>"I've always been frustrated about how unuser-friendly other citation generators are, so I decided to do something about it" - Liam Kinne (Founder)</blockquote>
    <p>Zite citation is all about staying out of the way, and just letting you get stuff done. We beleive you should be able to create a citation without having to lift your hands from the keyboard. It's simple, it's fast and unline other generators, we're not trying to sell you anything.</p>
    <p>We also want to give back to the community, as well as be transparent on any data we collect from our users. We do this by having our code be completely open source. It's hosted on <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/zitation/zite">GitHub</a>, so you can also contribute if you want.</p>
